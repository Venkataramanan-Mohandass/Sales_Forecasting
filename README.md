# Problem Statement


### Business Understanding

Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Since a lot of drugs come with a short shelf life, that is, they do not have a long expiry date, it becomes imperative for Rossmann to accurately forecast sales at their individual stores. Currently, the forecasting is taken care of by the store managers who are tasked with forecasting daily sales for the next six weeks. 

As expected, store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotional campaigns, competition, state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances and intuitions, the accuracy of the forecasts is quite varied. 


### Data Understanding

You have been provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores.

The data is provided in two tables â€“ 'stores' and 'train':
1) The store table contains the metadata for every single store.
2) The train table contains the sales data for individual stores at a daily level along with the details about the day.


### Business Goal

You need to build a forecasting model to accurately forecast the daily sales for the next six weeks. Forecasting must be done for each of the nine key stores, which are of business & historical significance to the company. These stores are numbered as 1,3,8,9,13,25,29,31,46.
